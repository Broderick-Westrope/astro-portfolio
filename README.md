# My Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal website ([link](https://westrope.dev)). It was build using:
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Vitesse theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/vitesse-theme-for-astro/) which I modified heavily
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Akar Icons](https://akaricons.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Extras

In addition to hosting portfolio stuff, I also use this site for a few odds and ends:
- [MTG Draft Calculator](https://www.westrope.dev/mtg-draft-calculator)
