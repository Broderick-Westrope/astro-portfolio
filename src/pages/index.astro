    <h1>Hi, I'm Broderick Westrope üëã </h1>
    <p>but most people call me Brodie :)</p>

    <p>
      By day I work as a consultant at <a href="https://mantelgroup.com.au/">Mantel Group</a>, where I break down business problems and craft solutions using a wide range of technologies in a cloud-first approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      By night I'm an avid open-source developer, speaker, and athlete.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Professional</h2>
    <p>
      My job as a consultant exposes me to a range of client projects, each with its own unique set of challenges and technologies.
      The core of my job is building <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> web services leveraging <strong>Temporal</strong>, <strong>ASP.NET</strong>, <strong>Connect RPC</strong>, and more!
    </p>

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>
      My code journey began at a young age, with a fascination for the
      limitless potential that software development provides (in
      comparison to my other options like Lego and Minecraft). I started
      by developing my own video games, eventually using the Unity engine
      with <strong>C#</strong>. This was my introduction to the world of{" "}
      <strong>.NET</strong> and quickly evolved into a career of web
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my professional endeavours, I'm a passionate advocate for FOSS, speaking at conferences, meetups, and contributing to open source projects.
      My priorities in life are promoting physical and mental wellbeing, and creating a sense of community in all environments.
      Outside of work I do a wide range of activities other than development. Bouldering üßó, reading üìö, Muay Thai ü•ã, motorcyles üèçÔ∏è, hiking ü•æ, and horticulture üåµ are just a few of my hobbies!
