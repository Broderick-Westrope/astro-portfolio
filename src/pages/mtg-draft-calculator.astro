                This tool optimizes <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cube draft configurations.
                Input your player count, cube size, and desired pool size to automatically
                calculate the optimal number of packs, cards per pack, and burn rate.
                It features preset configurations for common draft formats and real-time
                validation to ensure your setup stays within cube constraints while
                maximizing card variety for each player.

                is, it's essentially a custom-made draft environment. For this tool,
                think of "cube size" as the total number of cards available for the
                draft. For example, a traditional 8-person draft with 15-card booster
                packs (3 packs each) uses 360 cards total.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Pool Size</h3>
            <p>
                The pool size is the number of cards each player will have after
                drafting. This isn't their final deck size, but rather the total
                cards they can choose from when building their deck.

        <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Burn Cards</h3>
            <p>
                "Burn" refers to cards discarded from packs after everyone has
                picked. Some call this "pack discard." For example, if a pack
                starts with 15 cards and burns 5, players pick and pass until 5
                cards remainâ€”these get discarded. Burning cards lets smaller
                groups experience the same card variety as larger drafts without
                inflating individual pool sizes.
